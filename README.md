## Needed Items:
    * Database for every player so we don't have to re-crawl the entire website every single time
        * Alternaitvely could make a db entry for when a # first uses the website
    * Needs to check for most recent tournament on scrape to most recent tournament in DB to see if their needs to be a rescan for the player
    * Take the player number and spit out all the tournaments on left, their highest round, lowest round, etc in a nice format
    * **Needs to have the capabilities to add rounds to adjust their rating, remove rounds, etc.**
    * Should cache the user's information so they can have an SPOG for their stats just by going to the website
